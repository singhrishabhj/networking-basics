##  Topics Covered  

### 1. Introduction to Networking  
- **What is a Network?** â€“ Communication between devices to share resources.  
- **Types of Networks:** LAN, WAN, MAN, PAN, WLAN, VLAN.  
- **Networking Devices:** Router, Switch, Hub, Bridge, Modem, Repeater.  
- **Network Topologies:** Star, Bus, Ring, Mesh, Hybrid.  

### 2. OSI & TCP/IP Models  
- **OSI Model (7 Layers):** Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.  
- **Functions of Each Layer:** How data flows in a network.  
- **TCP/IP Model (4 Layers):** Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application.  
- **Comparison of OSI vs TCP/IP Models.**  

### 3. IP Addressing & Subnetting  
- **IPv4 Addressing:** Classes (A, B, C, D, E), Private vs Public IPs.  
- **IPv6 Addressing:** Structure, Benefits, Transition from IPv4.  
- **Subnetting Basics:** CIDR notation, Subnet Masks, How to divide networks.  
- **Supernetting:** Merging smaller subnets into a larger one.  

### 4. Networking Protocols  
- **Application Layer Protocols:** HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMTP, POP3, IMAP.  
- **Transport Layer Protocols:** TCP vs UDP â€“ Reliable vs Unreliable communication.  
- **Network Layer Protocols:** ICMP (ping), ARP, DHCP (IP allocation), DNS (Domain Resolution).  
- **Data Link Layer Protocols:** Ethernet, PPP, Frame Relay, MAC addresses.  

### 5. Basic Network Security  
- **Common Threats:** DDoS, MITM (Man-in-the-Middle), Phishing, Spoofing.  
- **Firewall & VPNs:** How they protect networks.  
- **Encryption Methods:** SSL, TLS, SSH â€“ Secure communication.  
- **Access Control & Authentication:** MAC filtering, Password policies.  

### 6. Network Troubleshooting Commands  
- **`ping`** â€“ Check connectivity between devices.  
- **`tracert` / `traceroute`** â€“ Find the path taken by packets.  
- **`netstat`** â€“ Display network connections.  
- **`nslookup` / `dig`** â€“ Query DNS records.  
- **`ipconfig` / `ifconfig`** â€“ View IP configuration on Windows/Linux.
